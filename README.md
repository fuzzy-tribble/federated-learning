# Implementation of a Basic Federated Learning Model

**Objective:** Build a simple federated learning model using a popular framework such as TensorFlow Federated or PySyft.

**Description:**

Implement a basic federated learning setup where multiple clients (agents) collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their local data.

Use a simple dataset, such as MNIST, and ensure that the model can aggregate updates from multiple clients.

The system should include basic local training, aggregation (e.g., Federated Averaging), and model evaluation.

**Objectives:**

- Understand how federated learning works and implement a model that can run across multiple local devices.

- Be able to aggregate updates from different devices in a secure and privacy-preserving way.

- Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy after federated training and compare it to a centralized version of the same model.
